Requirements:
* list of pokemon to search against
* be able to select pokemon
* retrieve details of pokemon from PokeAPI
* maintain a list of favorite pokemon?
** include a way to add and remove pokemon to the favorites list
* add custom pokemon?
** name, details, picture

Features:
* Favorites screen
* Inventory for Pokemon
* Let users save their preferences and settings
* Displaying the Pokemon
** Display screen should be interactive

Display Pokemon
* ID
* Name
* Sprites
* Moves (Customizable)
* Stats

Technical Aspect:
* use a modern CSS framework on how to style react components
* create themes (light/dark/custom?)
* create a database to persist data
* create a user login and store their data
* Pokeshop

Tech Stack:
* Tailwind CSS
* NextJS + React
* PostgreSQL
* backend service/api? see how NextJS supports having a backend api
* NestJS

TODO:
* Got data from PokeAPI and rendered it in a component on a page.
* Render a pageable list of pokemon and load basic data about the pokemon when you click on it.
** Display information about the selected pokemon.
** Get the first english description for the pokemon (see Caterpie #10)
** Get the sprite of the pokemon and display it.

Learned:
* Server and Client components need to be separated. Data is retrieved by Server components and displayed as static html. Interactive components can only exist in the Client components.
* Client components that require data fetches need to be synchronous.

* The layout is served and the sibling page.tsx is loaded inside the {children}.
* SVG components have properties available that we can access.

* Learned styling using Tailwind CSS.
* Moved the Pokemon Information styling into divs instead of SVGs.
* Learned about routing :)

11/21/22
* NextJS adds <div>s for each Page (each nested route path adds more divs).
  This is because of React doesn't allow finding the DOM node from a component (see: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/41745#discussioncomment-3969587)
* Found new CSS style. 'text-transform: capitalize' will capitalize the first letter of every word in that div (however, it will not make the rest of the letters lowercase).
