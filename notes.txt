Requirements:
* list of pokemon to search against
* be able to select pokemon
* retrieve details of pokemon from PokeAPI
* maintain a list of favorite pokemon?
** include a way to add and remove pokemon to the favorites list
* add custom pokemon?
** name, details, picture

Technical Aspect:
* use a modern CSS framework on how to style react components
* create themes (light/dark/custom?)
* create a database to persist data
* create a user login and store their data
* Pokeshop

Tech Stack:
* Tailwind CSS
* NextJS + React
* PostgreSQL
* backend service/api? see how NextJS supports having a backend api
* NestJS

TODO:
* Got data from PokeAPI and rendered it in a component on a page.
* Return pokemon data as a component and try and change the target pokemon that we get data from.
* Render a pageable list of pokemon and load basic data about the pokemon when you click on it.

Learned:
* Server and Client components need to be separated. Data is retrieved by Server components and displayed as static html. Interactive components can only exist in the Client components.
* Client components that require data fetches need to be synchronous.
